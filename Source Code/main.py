Welcome to Cloudcast! This interactive game tests your problem solving abilities (besides reviving the vintage era of text-based consoles). The setup is as follows:

The Hogwarts Meteorological Department owns a high-tech weather prediction software, which forecasts the upcoming month's weather statistics. This data is very valuable for the foreseeing and protection of the castles from threats. However, the return of the Dark Lord has messed their data up. As a result, the predictions have been offset by a large difference. Crunch time is approaching as Dark Magic is breaking through the shields around Hogwarts. The department, trusting you as an able logician, invites you to correct their data in limited moves.
'''
instructions = '''
You will be provided with two datasets, namely 30_day_forecasted_weather and 30_day_actual_weather. You may choose any week of the month, and any field out of - Temperature(T), Pressure(P) and Humidity(H) - from the predicted dataset, and change the department's prediction to your prediction. This costs a move, and you will have limited moves.
Your aim is to minimise the difference in your prediction and the recorded weather within restricted moves.
NOTE: Don't judge the game difficulty by the number of moves!

The Hogwarts Meteorological Department thanks you for your services. May the enchantments keep you safe.
